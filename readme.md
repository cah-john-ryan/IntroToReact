Installation notes (see the package.json file for your npm dependencies):
- (Core focus) React, the core library we are focusing on for this sesssion.
- react-dom, a supplemental library that helps React work with our HTML page.

- babel-cli, parts of React (JSX) won't run natively in a browser.  There are a few other Javascript feature we will use that won't run natively either.  Babel translates our Javascript files so that browsers can run our React code without issue.
- babel-preset-react-app, helps Babel with translating our React code.

- http-server, A simple http server to provide local web hosting.  (There's a lot of tools you can do this with, I am picking this as it is one I most frequently use for my own efforts)

A good reference point in setting up a basic page with React:
